# Calculator

A simple web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while also following the BODMAS rule for the correct order of operations.

Features
Basic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.
BODMAS Rule: The calculator respects the standard operator precedence (BODMAS) in its calculations.
Clear and Delete: Options to clear the entire input or delete the last character.
Responsive Design: A clean, minimalistic UI with responsive layout.
Live Demo
You can view and use the calculator in action by opening the index.html file in a browser.

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the calculator layout.
CSS: For styling the calculator interface.
JavaScript: For implementing the calculator's functionality, including handling button presses and performing arithmetic calculations.

How it Works
The calculator is composed of:

A display that shows the input and result of calculations.
Buttons for digits (0-9), operations (+, -, *, /, %), and special functions (clear, delete, equals).
The eval() function in JavaScript is used to evaluate expressions entered by the user, ensuring that the BODMAS (order of operations) is respected in calculations.
